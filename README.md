# Simplified ðŸ’¤LazyVim template
The [starter template](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) already comes with a bunch of plugins that impacts some of the UI and behabiours. Since I mostly want to use LazyVim as my Package Manager, I created this simplified template.

The template:
    - disables many of the plugins
    - has a dedicated Lua file in plugins/ for majority of enabled Plugins
    - Removes everything not active
